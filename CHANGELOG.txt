[b]0.40beta[/b] (Mar 29, 2014)
*Tiny changes on skin styling.
*Made another attempt on Target Detached Portrait. Mirrored the player one. Something is missing. Doesn't get the target changes onload. Re-enabling it or make any changes on target it applies.. reload and go kill yourself

[b]0.39beta[/b] (Mar 28, 2014)
*Reverted to Azilroka's skin file after his latest update in AddOnSkins (v2.15). A bit more fine tuning may needed.
*Removed the font.lua file. No need to force users to use BenikUI. On it's final release, BenikUI will have a seperate addon to override ElvUI name and damage font, to fit with BenikUI. What was added in 0.37b wasn't working as intended.
*Added option for the actionbars switch buttons. The user can now choose on which bar (1 or 2) the Switch buttons will show.
*Added style in WorldMap (needs testing for taints). The style applies only on small and quest map not on the big map.
*Fixed a visibility bug when the game menu and the bags were opened.
*Fine tune the install profile.

*Done with skin styling. Not with this result without Azilroka. Big thanks :)
*Added BenikUI Style in TinyDPS skin

[b]0.37beta[/b] (Mar 23, 2014)
*Azilroka's magic touch overhauled the styling functions and the skins. Still issues to solve though.
*Added option in ElvUI options -> General -> Media -> Fonts, that will force (or not) BenikUI fonts on names and combat text. This requires a client restart to apply.
